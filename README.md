<h1>Simple Network with Cisco Packet Tracer</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this cybersecurity lab, we will design and configure a home network in Cisco Packet Tracer to connect a Home Office to a Home Entertainment system. The network will consist of two sections, each featuring multiple end devices, including computers and smart devices, interconnected through a router and two switches. All interfaces will be configured with appropriate IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways. The devices will be connected using suitable Ethernet cables, and we will conduct connectivity tests to ensure successful communication between the Home Office and Home Entertainment, allowing clients to ping one another effectively.
