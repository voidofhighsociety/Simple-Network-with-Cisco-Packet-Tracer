<h1>Simple Network with Cisco Packet Tracer</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I will design and configure a simple home network in Cisco Packet Tracer with two subnets labeled Home Office and Home Entertainment. Each subnet will feature multiple end devices, including computers and printers, interconnected through a router and two switches. All interfaces will be configured with appropriate IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways. The devices will be connected using suitable Ethernet cables, and I will conduct connectivity tests to ensure successful communication between the Home Office and Home Entertainment, allowing clients to ping one another effectively.
